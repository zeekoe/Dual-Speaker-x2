# h850micboost
Magisk module to boost sound (video recording & handsfree calling)

### What does it do?
This module replaces "mixer-paths-tasha.xml" inside the "etc" folder of the vendor partition with a modified one.

### Thanks
To JisJ3rry and ShadoV90 others at XDA for writing the stuff I needed to know.
